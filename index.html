    <h2> Welcome to Miami! <h2>
    <h4> Home to famous crystal blue waters, delectable Cuban coffee, and rich history, Miami offers a variety of activities and places that visitors can indulge in. Our love for Miami is so big that we decided to dedicate an entire website to it. From Wynwood to Coral Gables, we hope to provide you with a myriad of places to visit and eat! Living in Miami for our entire lives has allowed us to truly know which places are the best to visit, especially as young adults.</h4>
    <h4> Miami was founded in 1894, after the Great Freeze occurred. The Great Freeze was when cities like Orlando and West Palm Beach hit record low temperatures of 18 degrees Fahrenheit, killing most of their crops. However, Miami’s crops were the only ones to survive.</h4>
    <h4> Julia Tuttle, an American business woman and land owner, was responsible for the establishment of Miami as a city. She was able to persuade Henry Flagler, the owner of a railroad company, to expand his railway all the way to Miami. On July 28, 1896, Miami was established as a city and its population was only a 300 people.</h4>
    <h4> During the early twentieth century, Miami experienced a period of economic growth. The population doubled and more and more land was available to settle in. However, during the ‘20s and ‘30s, Miami was hit by an economic depression, making the cost of living there extremely high.</h4>
    <h4> During World War II, Miami once again regained its popularity because of its central location in targeting German submarines. Therefore, after WWII, the population increased to almost half a million people.</h4>
    <h4> Subsequently, in the late twentieth century, Miami experienced even more growth. Now, Miami is characterized by its diverse culture, tropical temperatures, and beautiful beaches and people. </h4>
